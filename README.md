# PrioStack – Web, Workflows & AI

> PrioStack is a small boutique agency based in NRW, focused on  
> **websites, automated workflows and pragmatic consulting** for small and mid-sized businesses.

This repository does **not** contain the source code of our client projects.  
It is a short overview of what we do and what my role in the team is.

##  What we do

PrioStack helps companies turn messy online presence and manual processes into  
**clear websites, lean workflows and realistic AI use-cases**.

Our focus:

- **Websites** – WordPress business sites that load fast, are easy to use and can be maintained by non-technical teams.
- **Workflows** – automation with **n8n** and AI (e.g. forms → CRM, email, calendar, sheets).
- **Consulting** – honest, implementation-oriented sparring around websites, processes and tools.

We prefer clear scope, transparent pricing and solutions that the client can actually run after the project – no enterprise theatre.

##  Service overview

### 1. Websites (WordPress)

We build focused WordPress websites for small businesses that want more than a template, but don’t need a huge custom system.

Typical deliverables include:

- Structure & wireframe (navigation, page layout, clear CTAs)
- Implementation in WordPress (responsive for desktop/tablet/mobile)
- Basic SEO (clean headings, titles & meta, speaking URLs)
- Basic tracking setup (e.g. GA4, 1–2 key events such as contact/CTA)
- DSGVO-conform basics via templates (imprint, privacy, cookie notice)
- Short handover & documentation so the client can edit content

Optional, depending on scope:

- Simple forms → CRM or email
- Blog/news section
- Light performance tuning & copy refinement

### 2. Workflows (n8n & automation)

We design and implement small but realistic workflows instead of huge abstract process maps.

Typical workflow packages include:

- Process sketch (from current state to a simple, clear target workflow)
- MVP workflow in **n8n** (limited but stable and maintainable)
- Tool connections (forms, mail, calendar, CRM, Sheets, etc.)
- Tests with example data and clear error messages
- Short documentation & handover (how to start, check logs, debug)

Examples:

- **Lead flow:** website form → CRM → confirmation email  
- **Appointment flow:** request → calendar block → Teams/Slack note  
- **Data flow:** sheet → validation → report / notification  

Optional:

- Small AI steps (summarising / classifying, simple routing logic)
- Basic monitoring (e.g. error mails, log exports)

---

### 3. Consulting (Web, Workflows & AI)

We offer honest sparring for small teams – no buzzword theatre.

Typical consulting package:

- Short remote workshop (60–90 minutes) to clarify goals and current state
- Review of website/funnel or current process (incl. quick wins)
- Tool & architecture recommendations (e.g. WordPress, n8n, CRM, mail, sheets)
- Short & realistic roadmap instead of a 100-page strategy deck
- Summary as a Notion page or short PDF

Optional:

- Light prototype for one step
- Simple KPI suggestions (e.g. leads, throughput time)
- Short enablement / training
